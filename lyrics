Please could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken
Voices in my head
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Height
Rainâ€¦
